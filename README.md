# Multi-Period-OPF-cases
The following repository contains the data for [1], a paper describing the multi-period optimal power flow methodology that uses differencial dynamic programming to solve large testcases. 

The file, "case14_modified_ess.m" contains the data for the modified IEEE 14 bus testcase that includes an energy storage device on bus 2.
